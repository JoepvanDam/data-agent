## Question 6

#### Error: could not convert string to float: 'SMT'
Response time: 2.1220672130584717 seconds \
In tokens used: 2156 \
Out tokens used: 49
```json
{
    "Next": "ERROR",
    "Reason": "The correlation_matrix function requires all data to be numerical, but there are non-numerical columns in the dataset; hence, a method to select only numerical columns is missing."
}
```
Task error (different from when other models made this mistake, because of its reasoning:), because it says there is no method to select only numerical columns, but the drop_columns function exists in the prompt.
