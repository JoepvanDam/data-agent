#### Question formatting (error)
Response time: 5.4005115032196045 seconds \
In tokens used: 185 \
Out tokens used: 81
```json
{
    "Next": "FORMAT",
    "Formatted": "The 'Budget' column contains 104 entries with an average (mean) budget of 9.56 million, a median budget of 7.50 million, and a standard deviation of 7.20 million. The budget values range from a minimum of 1.00 million to a maximum of 25.00 million."
}
```
The 'try' is a successful format, but it's an accuracy error, because the model makes the assumption that the numbers are millions instead of floats. Thus, it did not accurately format the answer.

## Question 6
### Attempt = 1
#### Is there a correlation between 'AP' and 'SP'?
Response time: 6.646774530410767 seconds \
In tokens used: 2071 \
Out tokens used: 30
```json
{
    "Next": "ERROR",
    "Reason": "Missing a function to extract the correlation between two specific columns from the correlation matrix."
}
```
Accuracy error as this *IS* possible by combining the drop_columns and correlation_matrix functions.

        "parameters": {
            "data": "RESULT1"
        }
    }
}
```
Task error because the model seemingly 'forgot' about the non-numeric columns when running the correlation matrix, even though the prompt clearly says it's for numerical columns only.

## Question 8
### Attempt = 1
#### What is the average AP for each 'Naaminsp'?

            "agg_func": "mean"

Accuracy error, as the model should intrinsically know that the agg_func doesn't take average as a parameter.
